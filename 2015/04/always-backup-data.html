				<h2>Always backup data, always</h2>
				<h5>17 April, 2015</h5>
				<p>I haven’t talked much about this, mostly because I’m still somewhat traumatized, but last August I lost a large portion of my data.  Avoiding the gritty details, it was one of those freak mishaps where, in a system with <i>n</i> redundancies, <i>n+1</i> fail at once.</p>

				<p>Overall, I’d say I lost about 3-6 months in the process.  There was a month or more where I was waiting to see if it was recoverable, then the time spent afterward to re-do what was lost.</p>

				<p>I’ll be honest, it was incredibly frustrating for me. Mostly because events felt out of my control – there was nothing I could do to make it better besides just starting again. On the positive side, everything I had to recreate I did better and much more efficiently.  I was almost astonished at how much I had improved – it’s not something I notice on a daily basis, but this comparison really brought it out.</p>

				<p>After I sufficiently recovered from the shock, I decided to take a good look at how I store my work-related files.  I wanted to minimize the damage if something like this ever happened again.  I now have a system that works pretty well and makes me feel relatively safe.  If I lose the files I’m currently working on, I will lose only a month or less of progress, which is pretty reasonable, given that it only takes me a few hours each month to backup everything.</p>

				<p>If you don’t have your research files backed up in several locations, I highly recommend you do so now.  I’ve created an infographic (my first!) to illustrate my process.  Start there, and modify so that it works for you.</p>
