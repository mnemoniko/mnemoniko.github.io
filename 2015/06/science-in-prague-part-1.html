				<h2>Science in Prague: Part 1</h2>
				<h5>29 June, 2015</h5>
				<p>Greetings from Prague! After suffering from jetlag, rushing to hang up my poster, and bewailing my temperamental phone camera, I’ve finally settled in.</p>

				<p>I’m participating in IUGG2015, which stands for International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, which probably isn’t any clearer than the acronym. In essence, it’s a very large international organization where the members are countries, and the topics are any sort of earth science, from oceanography to atmospherics to earthquakes and so forth.</p>

				<p>So far it’s been an interesting experience for me. This isn’t a typical conference my research group goes to, but I jumped at the chance to attend as I was accepted to co-convene a session on ocean and ice shelves. I’ve been able to meet a fair amount of people I’ve heard of before, and that’s exciting. On the flip side, the first day or two I was at a loss to find anyone I knew, and spent a few meals on my own. People watching and the Prague landscape made up for the lack of companions.</p>

				<p>In the first two days I was here, I managed to navigate the public transportation system well enough to make it out of the airport, correctly pronounced 4 names (out of 4) in my session, and presented my poster. Now I can sit back, learn about other science, and enjoy my stay in the city.</p>

				<p>I’ll be back later with more updates, or follow along with me on Twitter or Instagram (mnemoniko on both) for more consistent updates.</p>
